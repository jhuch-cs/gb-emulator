# gb-emulator

Welcome, team mates! This is the right place.

## What's What

* The source code for the emulator core is living in `./core`
* `main.c` right now is just a SDL2 proof-of-concept
* If you're developing on Windows, `build.bat` should compile the project to `gb-emulator.exe`, provided you have set up your SDL2 environment.
* If you're developing on a Unix-like machine (Linux, MacOS), `build.sh` should compile the project to an executable binary `gb-emulator`, provided you have the SDL2 dev environment installed. However, I haven't tested that, so YMMV.
